You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.

There are 342 different charts: for boys and girls, for preterms, for different age ranges, for specific ethnic groups, for height, weight, BMI, and so on. Each chart design has a chartcode, a character code identifying the design. This section explains the construction of the chart codes. The GitHub repository https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/chartbox contains the chart libraries that are available to JAMES. The list_charts() function produces a tabular overview. charts &lt;- chartbox::list_charts() dim(charts) ## [1] 342 8 charts[c(1, 22, 23, 300, 301, 340), ] ## chartgrp chartcode population sex design side language week ## 1 nl2010 HJAA HS male A front dutch ## 22 nl2010 HMBH HS female B hgt dutch ## 23 nl2010 HMBR HS female B wfh dutch ## 300 preterm PMEAN32 PT female E front dutch 32 ## 301 preterm PMEAN33 PT female E front dutch 33 ## 340 who WMBA WHOpink female B front dutch The chartbox package currently contains three chart groups: nl2010, preterm and who. Each groups collects charts of a similar type. Chart Group Charts Chart code Description Source nl2010 136 CCCC Dutch children 0-21 years, including minorities Talma et al.

The table below specifies the full coding schema used to construct the chartcodes.

Likewise, PMEAN33 codes for the chart of preterm (M), girls (M), 0-4 years (E), front side (A), Dutch language (N) born at 33 weeks of gestation (33). Some forms hold multiple growth charts. For example, the NJAA chart is designed for a A4 paper size (297mm \\(\\times\\) 210mm) and holds three growth charts: head circumference by age, length by age, and weight by age. Some others no chart, like NJAB with explanations. All square formats holds one growth chart. All of square format have equal sizes (160mm \\(\\times\\) 160mm). The measures per design-form combination are listed in the following table.
