The specification closely follows the definition of the Basisdataset JGZ 3.25 (2018); defines data objects; defines the actions taken by JAMES in case of incorrect, missing or out-of-range data; defines the error messages for informing the client. 3.2 Generic object model 3.2.1 EPremDossier Class 3.2.1.1 Object model EPremDossier Instance Class -&gt; Clientgegevens EPremGroep -&gt; Contactmomenten EPremContactmoment 3.2.1.2 Syntax C# public class EPremDossier 3.2.1.3 Public properties Name Description Required Clientgegevens Class with basic child data Y Contactmomenten Class with data per visit N InstrumentCode Integer identifying the instrument Ignored OrganisatieCode Integer identifying the care organisation Y Referentie String identifying the request N 3.2.2 EPremGroep Class 3.2.2.1 Object model EPremGroep Instance Class -&gt; Elementen EPremElement -&gt; Groepen EPremGroep 3.2.2.2 Syntax C# public class EPremGroep 3.2.2.3 Public properties Name Description Required Elementen Class with BDS-elements Y Groepen Class with groups of BDS-elements N 3.2.3 EPremElement Class 3.2.3.1 Syntax C# public class EPremElement 3.2.3.2 Public properties Name Description Required Bdsnummer Integer identifying the BDS-field Y InternNummer Integer identifying internal field Ignored Waarde Value of the BDS-field Y Waardeomschrijving Descriptive label for value Ignored 3.2.4 EPremContactmoment Class 3.2.4.1 Object model EPremContactmoment Instance Class -&gt; Elementen EPremElement -&gt; Groepen EPremGroep 3.2.4.2 Syntax C# public class EPremContactmoment : EPremGroep 3.2.4.3 Public properties Name Description Required Elementen Class with BDS-elements Y Groepen Class with groups of BDS-elements N Tijdstip Date of visit Y 3.3 BDS-elements BDS Description Value Label Required 19 Sex of child “0” Unknown Y “1” Male “2” Female “3” Not specified 20 Date of birth “yyyymmdd” year-month-day Y 62 Caretaker relation “01” biological father N “02” biological mother “03” male partner, stepfather “04” female partner, stepmother “05” adoptive father “06” adoptive mother “07” foster father “08” foster mother “98” other 63 Caretaker date of birth “yyyymmdd” year-month-day N 66 Caretaker education “01” no primary school N “02” primary school, special ed “03” VSO-MLK/IVBO/VMBO-LWOO “04” LBO/VBO/VMBO-BBL&amp;KBL “05” MAVO/VMBO-GL&amp;TL “06” MBO “07” HAVO/VWO “08” HBO/HTS/HEAO “09” WO “98” Other “00” Unknown 71 Caretaker birth country “dddd” 4-digit code, Table 34 N 82 Gestational age “ddd” in days N 91 Smoking during pregnancy “1” yes N “2” no “99” unknown 110 Birth weight “dddd” 3-4 digits, grammes N 235 Length/height “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters N 245 Body weight “dddddd” 3-6 digits, grammes N 252 Head circumference “ddd” 2-3 digits, millimeters N 238 Height biological mother “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters N 240 Height biological father “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters N 510 Passive smoking “01” No smoking in house N “02” Never with child “03” Not in last 7 days “04” Yes 3.4 Error checking Error checking of the JSON data occurs in three phases: PHASE 1: Check whether the JSON data are valid JSON. The process terminates with an error message if the input JSON is not valid. PHASE 2: Validate the JSON data against the JSON schema specification. The process terminates with an error if any required fields are missing. The process generates messages for data points that do not conform to the JSON schema, but continues. PHASE 3: Check the range of the numeric data. The process generates messages for out-of-range values, but continues using the specified values. The default JSON schema in phase 2 is the built-in JSON schema bds_schema_str.json, a data format implementing a version that accepts strings as values for BDS-elements. "],
["growth-charts-in-james.html", "Chapter 4 Growth charts in JAMES 4.1 Chart naming conventions", " Chapter 4 Growth charts in JAMES 4.1 Chart naming conventions The link https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/ contains an interactive overview of the available growth charts. There are 342 different charts: for boys and girls, for preterms, for different age ranges, for specific ethnic groups, for height, weight, BMI, and so on. Each chart has a chart code, a character code identifying the design. This section explains the construction of the chart codes. The GitHub repository https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/chartbox contains the chart libraries that are available to JAMES. The list_charts() function produces a tabular overview. charts &lt;- chartbox::list_charts() dim(charts) ## [1] 342 8 charts[c(1, 22, 23, 300, 301, 340), ] ## chartgrp chartcode population sex design side language week ## 1 nl2010 HJAA HS male A front dutch ## 22 nl2010 HMBH HS female B hgt dutch ## 23 nl2010 HMBR HS female B wfh dutch ## 300 preterm PMEAN32 PT female E front dutch 32 ## 301 preterm PMEAN33 PT female E front dutch 33 ## 340 who WMBA WHOpink female B front dutch The chartbox package currently contains three chart groups: nl2010, preterm and who. Each group collects charts of a similar type. Chart Group Charts Chart code Description Source nl2010 136 CCCC Dutch children 0-21 years, including minorities Talma et al.

The table below specifies the full coding schema used to construct the chart codes.

Likewise, PMEAN33 codes for the chart of preterm (M), girls (M), 0-4 years (E), front side (A), Dutch language (N) born at 33 weeks of gestation (33). Some forms hold multiple growth charts. For example, the NJAA chart is designed for A4 paper size (297mm \\(\\times\\) 210mm) and contains three growth charts: head circumference by age, length by age, and weight by age. Some others have no diagram, like NJAB with explanations. All square formats hold one growth chart. All of the square forms have equal sizes (160mm \\(\\times\\) 160mm). The following table lists the measures per design-form combination.
