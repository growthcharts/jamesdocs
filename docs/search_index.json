This document contains documentation of the Joint Automatic Measurement and Evaluation System (JAMES). JAMES is fully programmed in R and makes it functionality available as an API running under OpenCPU. This contents of the file is fully in the works. It is it neither complete nor garanteed to be accurate, consider it as a journey guide for your travel through JAMES. Nevertheless, I hope that it will help to understand basic ideas, technologies and applications. Last version: June 2021.

JAMES is an experimental web service for creating and interpreting charts of child growth and development. The current version provides access to high-quality over 300 growth charts used by the Dutch youth health care; interchanges data coded according to the Basisdataset JGZ; screens for abnormal height, weight and head circumference; converts developmental data into the D-score; plot D-scores on special D-score charts; predicts future growth and development. The service can be used by anyone interested in high-quality charts for monitoring and evaluating childhood growth and development. This chapter highlights the components of JAMES. 1.2 Architecture JAMES provides its services through OpenCPU, an open system for scientific computing and reproducible research. The system allows for easy integration of growth charts into any HTTPS compliant client by means of OpenCPU’s API. The JAMES webservice is a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API). The contents of the system consist of two parts: JAMES: A collection of R packages that provides back-end functionality JESSE: A gateway front-end JAMES that translates incoming and outcoming requests (not yet realised) 1.3 R packages 1.3.1 JAMES Active packages Active packages reside on the JAMES server and provide all functionality.

Data accepted by JAMES should follow the JSON schema defined at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/growthcharts/bdsreader/srm/inst/schemas/bds_v3.0.json. For backward compatibility, JAMES supports older versions of the schema (v1.0, v1.1 and v2.0). Do not use these deprecated formats for new applications. 2.3 Error checking policy Error checking of the JSON data occurs in three phases: PHASE 1: Check whether the JSON data are valid JSON. The process terminates with an error message if the input JSON is not valid. PHASE 2: Validate the JSON data against the JSON schema specification. The process terminates with an error if any required fields are missing. The process generates messages for data points that do not conform to the JSON schema, but continues. PHASE 3: Check the range of the numeric data. The process generates messages for out-of-range values, but continues using the specified values. The default JSON schema in PHASE 2 is the built-in JSON schema bds_v3.0.json, a data format implementing a version that accepts strings as values for BDS-elements. 2.4 Checking structure of the input data against the JSON schema The inst/extdata/bds_v3.0 directory of the jamesdemodata package contains examples of input data in JSON format. Non-R user can access these from GitHub from link https://github.com/growthcharts/jamesdemodata/tree/master/inst/extdata/bds_v3.0. Manual checking the structure of your child data can be done as follows. Surf to https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net, paste the JSON schema definition in the left panel and paste the child data in the right panel. You should see something like the Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Manual validation of a child dataset (right side) according JSON schema bds_v3.0.json. Experiment with your child file (e.g. remove the required Format field) to see what types errors the validator can catch. 2.5 BDS-elements supported by JAMES BDS Description Value Label R name 19 Sex of child “0” Unknown sex “1” Male “2” Female “3” Not specified 20 Date of birth “yyyymmdd” year-month-day dob 62 Caretaker relation “01” biological father “02” biological mother “03” male partner, stepfather “04” female partner, stepmother “05” adoptive father “06” adoptive mother “07” foster father “08” foster mother “98” other 63 Caretaker date of birth “yyyymmdd” year-month-day dobf dobm agem 66 Caretaker education “01” no primary school - “02” primary school, special ed “03” VSO-MLK/IVBO/VMBO-LWOO “04” LBO/VBO/VMBO-BBL&amp;KBL “05” MAVO/VMBO-GL&amp;TL “06” MBO “07” HAVO/VWO “08” HBO/HTS/HEAO “09” WO “98” Other “00” Unknown 71 Caretaker birth country “dddd” 4-digit code, Table 34 etn (always NL) 82 Gestational age “ddd” in days gad 91 Smoking during pregnancy “1” yes smo “2” no “99” unknown 110 Birth weight “dddd” 3-4 digits, grammes bw (g) 235 Length/height “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters hgt (cm) 245 Body weight “dddddd” 3-6 digits, grammes wgt (kg) 252 Head circumference “ddd” 2-3 digits, millimeters hdc (cm) 238 Height biological mother “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters hgtf (cm) 240 Height biological father “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters hgtm (cm) 510 Passive smoking “01” No smoking in house - “02” Never with child “03” Not in last 7 days “04” Yes JAMES supports the following BDS numbers with Van Wiechen items: 879, 881, 883, 884, 885, 887, 888, 889, 890, 891, 894, 896, 897, 898, 902, 903, 906, 907, 910, 912, 914, 916, 917, 918, 920, 922, 923, 926, 945, 951, 955, 956, 958, 959, 961, 962, 964, 966, 968, 970, 971, 973, 975, 977, 978, 986, 989, 991, 993, 994, 996, 999, 1002, 886, 892, 893, 900, 905, 909, 913, 921, 927, 928, 930, 931, 932, 933, 934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 943, 947, 948, 949, 950, 953, 954, 972, 980, 982, 984, 998, 1001, 1278.

Likewise, PMEAN33 codes for the chart of preterm (M), girls (M), 0-4 years (E), front side (A), Dutch language (N) born at 33 weeks of gestation (33). Some forms hold multiple growth charts. For example, the NJAA chart is designed for A4 paper size (297mm \\(\\times\\) 210mm) and contains three growth charts: head circumference by age, length by age, and weight by age. Some others have no diagram, like NJAB. All square formats hold just one growth chart. All of the square forms have equal sizes (160mm \\(\\times\\) 160mm).

The top-level package at https://github.com/growthcharts/james also defines a Javascript interface in the inst/www directory. Deployment of JAMES relies on the OpenCPU server. In principle, it is enough to install the james package on the OpenCPU server, and will also install all dependencies. The following is needed to build and run a JAMES image: Permission to read from the following private repo’s: growthcharts/chartplotter growthcharts/curvematching growthcharts/donorloader growthcharts/jamesdocker If needed, a personal Github token with repo scope from here, Generate a token with only scope repo. Install Docker Desktop on your local machine, and run some tutorials 7.3 Dockerfile The Dockerfile is at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/growthcharts/jamesdocker/master/Dockerfile, which is located in the private repo https://github.com/growthcharts/jamesdocker. You need authentication to use this resource. Clone the growthcharts/jamesdocker repo to your machine Set working directory to root of jamesdocker If needed: Add the file docker/opencpu_config/Renviron with contents GITHUB_PAT=fa2... with your own GITHUB_PAT. 7.4 Docker commands Build the james image, type in a terminal docker build -t james . This may takes a long time (30 minutes), in which the entire application is downloaded from various web-locations. After (hopefully successful) completion, check the image docker images -a If all is well, the top line is called james. Now run the container on your local machine: docker run -t -d -p 80:80 james If the ports are already taken by other containers, stop and remove all containers: docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) Reissue the docker run, and the container should now run. Check by docker ps which should list a container created from the james image. If you want to enter the container use docker exec -i -t 6c /bin/bash where 6c are the first two characters of the container ID. Inside the container, check font matching of Arial as fc-match Arial 7.5 Checks with the browser http://localhost should show Apache2 Ubuntu default screen. http://localhost/ocpu/test/ should show OpenCPU test page. http://localhost/rstudio/ should start the Rstudio IDE - if installed . Use opencpu:opencpu to log in. http://localhost/ocpu/library/james/www/ should start the JAMES javascript interface. See also https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/opencpu/rstudio 7.6 Security Don’t use the intermediate container, since it will contain your token in /.Renviron. The latest (james) container does not hold your token, and can be shared. The container is shielded from the machine on which it runs. However, the materials within the container are only protected by R_LIMITS. In general, for production it is wise to add restriction on the OpenCPU server. "],["certificates.html", "Chapter 8 Certificates 8.1 Objective 8.2 vps.stefvanbuuren.nl", " Chapter 8 Certificates 8.1 Objective The use of htpps requires that Apache runs with proper and validated certificates. Users can assess the status of the certificate by clicking on the slot in the browser bar. Certificates are issues by a Certificate Authority (CA) and are valid for one year. The period of one year is just enough to forget how to install and update certificates. This text shows how to renew the certificate. 8.2 vps.stefvanbuuren.nl The server runs Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. The Apache configuration file /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf contains the following lines SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/crt/vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.chained.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/crt/vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.key The file .key is the private key, which should not leave the machine and only be read/write by sudoers. The file ..chained.crt is the certificate file, which needs to be updated after expiry. There is some hand work involved in creating this file. 8.2.1 Step 1: Create the CSR file ssh into vps.stefvanbuuren.nl cd /etc/ssl/crt openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.key -out vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.csr You need to answer some questions (See http://edtechchris.com/2020/02/11/generate-csr-with-openssl-on-ubuntu/). Show the result: cat vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.csr Copy the contents of the CSR file onto the clipboard. Save also on desktop under Package/james/certificates_vps.stefvanbuuren.nl/{expiryyear} for archiving. 8.2.2 Step 2: Buy new certificate The current CA is Network Solutions. Log into their website, and pay their renewal fee (about $86 per year). Select Apache/Ubuntu, paste CSR clipboard file into appropriate box, and submit. Within 30 minutes you get a request to validate in the mailbox. After that is done, you get a new mail saying that certificates are available. Download everything. 8.2.3 Step 3: Create the crt file Collect the following four files into Package/james/certificates_vps.stefvanbuuren.nl/{expiryyear}. dv_chain.txt DV_NetworkSolutionsDVServerCA2.crt DV_USERTrustRSACertificationAuthority.crt VPS.STEFVANBUUREN.NL.crt Create a new file as follows: Open with text editor dv_chain.txt and VPS.STEFVANBUUREN.NL.crt Paste the contents of VPS.STEFVANBUUREN.NL.crt before the contents of dv_chain.txt. There will be three sections. Save the result under file name vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.chained.crt 8.2.4 Step 4: Transfer to server Copy the file onto the server, home directory, by ftp. Move it in place by sudo mv vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.chained.crt /etc/ssl/crt/vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.chained.crt This overwrites the expired certificate. 8.2.5 Step 5: Restart Apache2 If you changed /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf check for syntactic validity. apachectl configtest If OK, then sudo apachectl restart If all is well, Apache restarts and uses the updated certificate. 8.2.6 Troubleshooting If it doesn’t work, check whether the results of the following statements are identical. openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.chained.crt | openssl md5 sudo openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in vps.stefvanbuuren.nl.key | openssl md5 If not, there is a mismatch between private key and certificate. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26191463/ssl-error0b080074x509-certificate-routinesx509-check-private-keykey-values?rq=1 for fixes.
