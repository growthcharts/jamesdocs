The specification closely follows the definition of the Basisdataset JGZ 3.25 (2018); defines data objects; defines the actions taken by JAMES in case of incorrect, missing or out-of-range data; defines the error messages for informing the client. 3.2 Generic object model 3.2.1 EPremDossier Class 3.2.1.1 Object model EPremDossier Instance Class -&gt; Clientgegevens EPremGroep -&gt; Contactmomenten EPremContactmoment 3.2.1.2 Syntax C# public class EPremDossier 3.2.1.3 Public properties Name Description Required Clientgegevens Class with basic child data Y Contactmomenten Class with data per visit N InstrumentCode Integer identifying the instrument Ignored OrganisatieCode Integer identifying the care organisation Y Referentie String identifying the request N 3.2.2 EPremGroep Class 3.2.2.1 Object model EPremGroep Instance Class -&gt; Elementen EPremElement -&gt; Groepen EPremGroep 3.2.2.2 Syntax C# public class EPremGroep 3.2.2.3 Public properties Name Description Required Elementen Class with BDS-elements Y Groepen Class with groups of BDS-elements N 3.2.3 EPremElement Class 3.2.3.1 Syntax C# public class EPremElement 3.2.3.2 Public properties Name Description Required Bdsnummer Integer identifying the BDS-field Y InternNummer Integer identifying internal field Ignored Waarde Value of the BDS-field Y Waardeomschrijving Descriptive label for value Ignored 3.2.4 EPremContactmoment Class 3.2.4.1 Object model EPremContactmoment Instance Class -&gt; Elementen EPremElement -&gt; Groepen EPremGroep 3.2.4.2 Syntax C# public class EPremContactmoment : EPremGroep 3.2.4.3 Public properties Name Description Required Elementen Class with BDS-elements Y Groepen Class with groups of BDS-elements N Tijdstip Date of visit Y 3.3 BDS-elements BDS Description Value Label Required 19 Sex of child “0” Unknown Y “1” Male “2” Female “3” Not specified 20 Date of birth “yyyymmdd” year-month-day Y 62 Caretaker relation “01” biological father N “02” biological mother “03” male partner, stepfather “04” female partner, stepmother “05” adoptive father “06” adoptive mother “07” foster father “08” foster mother “98” other 63 Caretaker date of birth “yyyymmdd” year-month-day N 66 Caretaker education “01” no primary school N “02” primary school, special ed “03” VSO-MLK/IVBO/VMBO-LWOO “04” LBO/VBO/VMBO-BBL&amp;KBL “05” MAVO/VMBO-GL&amp;TL “06” MBO “07” HAVO/VWO “08” HBO/HTS/HEAO “09” WO “98” Other “00” Unknown 71 Caretaker birth country “dddd” 4-digit code, Table 34 N 82 Gestational age “ddd” in days N 91 Smoking during pregnancy “1” yes N “2” no “99” unknown 110 Birth weight “dddd” 3-4 digits, grammes N 235 Length/height “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters N 245 Body weight “dddddd” 3-6 digits, grammes N 252 Head circumference “ddd” 2-3 digits, millimeters N 238 Height biological mother “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters N 240 Height biological father “dddd” 3-4 digits, millimeters N 510 Passive smoking “01” No smoking in house N “02” Never with child “03” Not in last 7 days “04” Yes 3.4 Error checking Error checking of the JSON data occurs in three phases: PHASE 1: Check whether the JSON data are valid JSON. The process terminates with an error message if the input JSON is not valid. PHASE 2: Validate the JSON data against the JSON schema specification. The process terminates with an error if any required fields are missing. The process generates messages for data points that do not conform to the JSON schema, but continues. PHASE 3: Check the range of the numeric data. The process generates messages for out-of-range values, but continues using the specified values. The default JSON schema in phase 2 is the built-in JSON schema bds_schema_str.json, a data format implementing a version that accepts strings as values for BDS-elements. "],
["growth-charts-in-james.html", "Chapter 4 Growth charts in JAMES 4.1 Chart naming conventions", " Chapter 4 Growth charts in JAMES 4.1 Chart naming conventions The link https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/ contains an interactive overview of the available growth charts. There are 342 different charts: for boys and girls, for preterms, for different age ranges, for specific ethnic groups, for height, weight, BMI, and so on. Each chart has a chart code, a character code identifying the design. This section explains the construction of the chart codes. The GitHub repository https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/chartbox contains the chart libraries that are available to JAMES. The list_charts() function produces a tabular overview. charts &lt;- chartbox::list_charts() dim(charts) ## [1] 394 8 charts[c(1, 22, 23, 300, 301, 340), ] ## chartgrp chartcode population sex design side language week ## 1 nl2010 HJAA HS male A front dutch ## 22 nl2010 HMBH HS female B hgt dutch ## 23 nl2010 HMBR HS female B wfh dutch ## 300 preterm PMAHN28 PT female A hgt dutch 28 ## 301 preterm PMAHN29 PT female A hgt dutch 29 ## 340 preterm PMEAN32 PT female E front dutch 32 The chartbox package currently contains three chart groups: nl2010, preterm and who. Each group collects charts of a similar type. Chart Group Charts Chart code Description Source nl2010 136 CCCC Dutch children 0-21 years, including minorities Talma et al.

The table below specifies the full coding schema used to construct the chart codes.

Likewise, PMEAN33 codes for the chart of preterm (M), girls (M), 0-4 years (E), front side (A), Dutch language (N) born at 33 weeks of gestation (33). Some forms hold multiple growth charts. For example, the NJAA chart is designed for A4 paper size (297mm \\(\\times\\) 210mm) and contains three growth charts: head circumference by age, length by age, and weight by age. Some others have no diagram, like NJAB with explanations. All square formats hold one growth chart. All of the square forms have equal sizes (160mm \\(\\times\\) 160mm). The following table lists the measures per design-form combination.

["dockerfile-for-james.html", "Chapter 7 Dockerfile for JAMES 7.1 Objective 7.2 Pre-requisites 7.3 Dockerfile 7.4 Docker commands 7.5 Checks with the browser 7.6 Security", " Chapter 7 Dockerfile for JAMES 7.1 Objective This chapter describes how to build and deploy JAMES as a Docker container. 7.2 Pre-requisites JAMES is currently constructed from a collection of R packages. The top-level package at https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/james also defines a Javascript interface in the inst/www directory. Deployment of JAMES relies on the OpenCPU server. In principle, it is enough to install the james package on the OpenCPU server, and will also install all dependencies. The following is needed to build and run a JAMES image: Permission to read from the following private repo’s: stefvanbuuren/chartplotter stefvanbuuren/clopus stefvanbuuren/curvematching stefvanbuuren/donorloader Personal Github token with repo scope from here, Generate a token with only scope repo. Install Docker Desktop on your local machine, and run some tutorials 7.3 Dockerfile FROM opencpu/rstudio as intermediate # install for V8 package RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \\ libv8-dev # repo_token.txt should be something like &quot;GITHUB_PAT=624adeaa...&quot; # to be able to install packages from private repo&#39;s COPY repo_token.txt .Renviron # install R packages needed for JAMES RUN \\ R -e &#39;install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;)&#39; \\ R -e &#39;remotes::install_github(&quot;stefvanbuuren/james&quot;)&#39; # rebuild the layer FROM opencpu/rstudio LABEL maintainer=&quot;stef.vanbuuren@tno.nl&quot; # re-install for V8 package RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \\ libv8-dev COPY --from=intermediate /usr/local/lib/R/site-library /usr/local/lib/R/site-library CMD service cron start &amp;&amp; /usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver &amp;&amp; apachectl -DFOREGROUND Create a fresh directory, and cd to this directory in your terminal Store the script given above in a file named Dockerfile Create a file named repo_token.txt with one line: GITHUB_PAT=624adeaa... with your token 7.4 Docker commands Build the james image, type in a terminal docker build -t james . This may takes a long time (30-60 minutes), in which the entire application is downloaded from various web-locations. After (hopefully succesful) completion, check the image docker images If all is well, the top line is called james. Now run the container on your local machine: docker run -t -d -p 80:80 -p 8004:8004 james If the ports are already taken by other containers, stop and remove all containers: docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) Reissue the docker run, and the container should now run. Check by docker ps which should list a container created from the james image. 7.5 Checks with the browser http://localhost should show Apache2 Ubuntu default screen. http://localhost/ocpu/test/ should show OpenCPU test page. http://localhost/rstudio/ should start the Rstudio IDE on the container. Use opencpu:opencpu to log in. http://localhost/ocpu/library/james/www/ should start the JAMES javascript interface. See also https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/opencpu/rstudio 7.6 Security The container is shielded from the machine on which it runs. However, the materials within the container are not protected. Don’t use intermediate containers, since these contain your token in /.Renviron. The latest (james) container does not hold your token, and can be shared, of course, keeping in mind remark 1. "],
